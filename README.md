## About Me ##
My name is Abigail Persky. This is my first experience with web design and I am really excited, but admittedly very nervous. I work for TBWA/WorldHealth and live in Tampa, FL. When not working you can find me training for my next half marathon, watching the latest blockbuster, going to see my favorite musical artists, or watching the Cleveland Browns. 

## Past Coding Experience ##
I have no previous coding experience, so I am excited to add to my skill set. I am hoping my better understanding will allow me to better manage client expectations for digital projects and better partner with web developers in the short term. In the long term, I want this foundation to help me understand what how digital opportunities operate. 

## Career Goals ##
I am currently in Account Service, but I am purusing digital strategy to make the transition into brand strategy, potentially focusing in social and digital efforts. I love being in Pharma and Health Care Advertising for the challenge, but look forward to eventually transitioning into the consumer space.
